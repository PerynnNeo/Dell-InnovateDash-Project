  // --- Cancer Basics ---
  "What is Cancer": `
Cancer is a group of diseases where certain cells in the body start to grow and multiply uncontrollably, sometimes forming a lump (called a tumour) or spreading to other parts of the body. Not all tumours are cancer, but malignant (cancerous) tumours can invade nearby tissues or organs and even spread through blood or lymph. Early detection and treatment greatly improve outcomes!
  `.trim(),

  "How Cancer Starts": `
Our bodies have trillions of cells that grow and divide in a controlled way. Sometimes this process goes wrong and cells keep multiplying without dying, forming tumours. Benign tumours stay in one place and aren't usually dangerous. Malignant tumours can spread and cause more problems. Some cancers, like leukaemia, don’t form solid tumours at all.
  `.trim(),

  "What Causes Cancer": `
There isn't one single cause of cancer. It’s usually a mix of different things, including:
- Genetics: Some families have a higher risk.
- Smoking: Tobacco is a major cause.
- Sun/UV Exposure: Too much sun can cause skin cancer.
- Radiation: Over time, exposure to radiation can increase risk.
- Past cancer treatment: Chemo/radiation can slightly raise your future risk.
Lifestyle and environment play a big role. Sometimes, there’s no clear reason at all.

  // --- Colorectal Cancer ---
  "What is Colorectal Cancer": `
Colorectal cancer is cancer of the colon and rectum, which are parts of the large intestine. It usually starts as a polyp, a small lump inside the colon or rectum. Some polyps can turn into cancer over time. Most people with colorectal cancer are over 50. Early colorectal cancer may have no symptoms, so screening is important. Regular checks can detect and remove polyps before they become cancerous.
  `.trim(),

  "Colorectal Cancer Risk Factors": `
Things that can increase your risk of colorectal cancer include:
- Age: Risk increases after age 50.
- Family history: Especially if relatives had polyps or colorectal cancer.
- Personal history: Past polyps or bowel diseases like ulcerative colitis.
- Sedentary lifestyle or obesity.
- Eating a lot of processed/red meat and little fibre.
- Drinking alcohol.
- Certain inherited conditions (like familial polyposis).
But about half of patients have no known risk factors, so screening matters for everyone.
  `.trim(),

  "Colorectal Cancer Symptoms": `
Colorectal cancer often has no symptoms at first. Watch out for:
- Blood in your stools
- Changes in bowel habits (constipation or diarrhoea)
- Abdominal pain or discomfort
- Anaemia (low red blood cells)
- Lump in the abdomen
If you have any of these, talk to your doctor.
  `.trim(),

  "Colorectal Cancer Screening": `
Screening saves lives! Tests include:
- **FIT (Faecal Immunochemical Test):** Checks for blood in stool, which you can do at home. If positive, more tests follow.
- **Colonoscopy:** A flexible tube looks at your colon and rectum. Polyps can be removed at the same time.
- **Flexible sigmoidoscopy:** Looks at the lower part of the colon.
Ask your doctor about when to start screening (often from age 50, or earlier if high risk).
  `.trim(),

  "Colorectal Cancer Diagnosis": `
Diagnosis may include:
- Colonoscopy to view the colon and remove polyps or take tissue samples (biopsy)
- CT scan or ultrasound to check for spread
- Tumour marker blood tests (CEA)
- Biopsy is needed to confirm cancer
Your doctor will guide you on the right tests.
  `.trim(),

  "Colorectal Cancer Treatment": `
Main treatments are:
- **Surgery:** Removes the part of the colon/rectum with cancer and nearby lymph nodes. Sometimes a temporary or permanent stoma (colostomy) is needed.
- **Chemotherapy:** Medicines to kill cancer cells, especially if cancer has spread.
- **Radiotherapy:** Uses x-rays to kill cancer cells, mostly for rectal cancer or advanced disease.
Treatment plan depends on the cancer stage and your health. Early detection means less aggressive treatment!

  // --- Endometrial (Uterine) Cancer ---
  "What is Endometrial Cancer": `
Endometrial cancer (uterine cancer) starts in the lining of the uterus (womb). It’s the fourth most common cancer in women in Singapore. The main symptom is unusual vaginal bleeding, especially after menopause. Most cases are caught early and are very treatable.
  `.trim(),

  "Endometrial Cancer Risk Factors": `
Risk factors include:
- Age (older women are at higher risk)
- Obesity
- Diabetes
- Never being pregnant

Symptoms can include:
- Persistent cough or change in voice
- Blood in sputum (mucus coughed up)
- Chest pain, breathlessness, or wheezing
- Weight loss, fatigue, repeated chest infections
Lung cancer can spread before symptoms show. If you notice these signs, see a doctor.
  `.trim(),

  "Lung Cancer Screening and Diagnosis": `
Screening for high-risk people (age 50+, heavy smokers) can use a low-dose CT scan. Diagnosis may include X-rays, sputum tests, bronchoscopy (tube into lungs), and scans (CT, MRI, PET). Sometimes a biopsy is needed to confirm cancer.
  `.trim(),

  "Lung Cancer Treatment": `
Main treatments:
- Surgery: To remove the tumour if possible
- Radiotherapy: X-rays to kill cancer cells
- Chemotherapy: Cancer-killing medicines
- Targeted or immunotherapy: Newer medicines that attack cancer cells more precisely
Your treatment depends on cancer type, stage, and your health.
  `.trim(),

  // --- Nasopharyngeal Cancer ---
  "What is Nasopharyngeal Cancer": `
Nasopharyngeal cancer starts in the space behind the nose and below the brain. It's more common in men and in Chinese people, especially Cantonese. Risk factors include eating a lot of salted or preserved foods, infection with Epstein Barr virus, and family history. Early detection is important, as this cancer is curable when caught early.
  `.trim(),

  "Nasopharyngeal Cancer Symptoms": `
Most common symptoms:
- Painless lump in the neck (swollen lymph node)
- Nose bleeds, blocked nose, or blood in saliva
- Hearing loss, buzzing, ear pain, or discharge
If you have these, especially with risk factors, see a doctor.
  `.trim(),

  "Nasopharyngeal Cancer Diagnosis and Treatment": `
Diagnosis may involve:
- Endoscopic exam (camera through the nose)
- CT, MRI, or PET scans
- Blood tests for Epstein Barr virus
- Biopsy of tissue
Treatment is usually with radiotherapy (high-energy X-rays) and sometimes chemotherapy. Surgery is less common but can be used if the cancer returns after radiation.
  `.trim(),

  // --- Cervical Cancer (summarized) ---
  "What is Cervical Cancer": `
Cervical cancer starts in the cervix (the lower part of the uterus). Most cases are caused by certain strains of human papillomavirus (HPV). Regular screening and HPV vaccination are the best ways to prevent it.
  `.trim(),

  // --- Ovarian Cancer ---
  "What is Ovarian Cancer": `
Ovarian cancer is a type of cancer that starts in one or both of a woman’s ovaries—the organs that store eggs and produce hormones. It’s the fifth most common cancer in Singaporean women. Ovarian cancer often doesn’t show clear symptoms at first, so many women are diagnosed at a later stage.
  `.trim(),

  "Ovarian Cancer Types and Risk Factors": `
There are different types of ovarian cancer:
- Epithelial tumours (most common)
- Germ cell tumours (egg-producing cells)
- Stromal tumours (hormone-producing tissue)
Risks are higher if you have few or no pregnancies, a family history, high-fat diet, endometriosis, early first period or late menopause.
  `.trim(),

  "Ovarian Cancer Symptoms and Screening": `
Ovarian cancer can be tricky to spot early. Symptoms may include:
- Bloated tummy or discomfort
- Changes in bowel habits
- Abnormal bleeding
- Abdominal pain, enlarged abdomen
- Loss of appetite or weight
- Urinary complaints
There's no routine screening for average-risk women. If you have a strong family history, genetic counseling and regular checks (ultrasound, CA-125 blood test) may be recommended.
  `.trim(),

  "Ovarian Cancer Diagnosis and Treatment": `
Diagnosis includes a pelvic exam, ultrasound, blood tests (CA-125), CT scan, and sometimes biopsy. Treatment usually involves surgery to remove the ovaries and affected tissues, sometimes preserving fertility if possible. Chemotherapy is common, especially for advanced cases. Radiotherapy is used occasionally.
  `.trim(),

  // --- Prostate Cancer ---
  "What is Prostate Cancer": `
Prostate cancer is cancer of the prostate, a small gland below the bladder in men that helps make semen. It’s the 2nd most common cancer among men in Singapore. Most prostate cancers grow slowly, but some can be more aggressive.
  `.trim(),

  "Prostate Cancer Risk Factors and Symptoms": `
Risks include:
- Age (risk increases as men get older)
- Family history
- Smoking, some chemicals, high animal fat diet
Symptoms might include:
- Difficulty urinating
- Weak or interrupted urine flow
- Back pain or swelling of legs (advanced cases)
Some men have no symptoms, so regular checks are important if you're at risk.
  `.trim(),

  "Prostate Cancer Screening and Diagnosis": `
Screening may involve a digital rectal exam and a PSA blood test. If results are abnormal, ultrasound and a biopsy may be needed. Not all men need to be screened—ask your doctor if you’re unsure.
  `.trim(),

  "Prostate Cancer Treatment": `
Treatment depends on the cancer's stage and your health:
- Active surveillance for slow-growing cancers
- Surgery to remove the prostate (radical prostatectomy)
- Radiotherapy (high-energy rays)
- Hormone therapy (blocks male hormones)
- Chemotherapy for advanced disease
Your doctor will guide you on the best plan.
  `.trim(),

  // --- Stomach Cancer ---
  "What is Stomach Cancer": `
Stomach cancer (also called gastric cancer) starts in the lining of the stomach. It's caused by abnormal growth of cells that can form a tumour. Risk factors include Helicobacter pylori infection, certain diets (smoked, salted, or pickled foods), family history, chronic gastritis, and smoking.
  `.trim(),

  "Stomach Cancer Symptoms and Diagnosis": `
Symptoms may not show until later stages but can include:
- Persistent indigestion or heartburn
- Abdominal pain
- Nausea or vomiting
- Weight loss or loss of appetite
- Black stools (bleeding)
Diagnosis may involve gastroscopy (using a camera to look inside your stomach), biopsy, CT scan, and sometimes a barium meal X-ray.
  `.trim(),

  "Stomach Cancer Treatment": `
Treatment usually includes surgery to remove part or all of the stomach, and possibly surrounding tissues. Chemotherapy and radiotherapy may be used before or after surgery, or to relieve symptoms in advanced cases. Early treatment gives the best chance for recovery.
